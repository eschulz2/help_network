      <h3>Learn web development.</h3>
      <p>Courses found on NAMEOFTHING are created and taught by web developers who love to teach their skills to others.

      <p>Most courses found on this site are for students with little or no web development experience.  All you need is a strong desire to learn, although a laptop is also usually required.

      <p>You can express interest in one or several listed courses, and then it's up to the teacher to contact you and get you enrolled. 

      <p>The integrity of each course on NAMEOFTHING is very important to us, and sometimes we choose to interview teachers before allowing them to post a course on this site.  For this reason, we are currently only allowing courses in Chicago and New York City. </P>
